\section{Purpose}
\subsection{Purpose of the Document}
This document is an introduction to the MondialDB project. It will provide details on the implementation and purpose of MondialDB. This document will provide a detailed design of MondialDB. It will include an information flow diagram and task forms that go into the inner workings of the project. It will also include the problems we encountered and the solutions we had for them.

\subsection{Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of the project is to create a database that can access various details about the World Cup. It will contain soccer team names and members and statistics such as player records, team records, penalty information, and the rank obtained. Another major part of this project is creating a tool to extract information about the World Cup from the Internet. It will be able to extract information from various websites and put them into a database readable format. The tool will be able to deal with data from European and American websites and transform it into a standard format. This project will allow for easy and readable queries.

\subsection{Purpose of Phase 1}
In this phase of the project we must design the database and receive feedback on it. We will attempt to catch any significant errors in design at this stage and prevent a broken or severely flawed implementation from going through. If design errors are caught early it will require considerably less work to fix them. 

\subsection{Purpose of Phase 2}
In this phase of the project we must create the graphical schema, relational schema, and pseudo code for the project.

\subsection{Purpose of Phase 3}
In this phase of the project we must create a user manual on how to use the 
completed database system.

\section{Problems and Solutions}
The following list is composed of problems we encountered with the conceptual design of the project.
\begin{itemize}
  \item 
  Problem: We lack database design experience. Without experience, it is difficult to design a database.
  
  Solution:  Follow project examples and study how databases are designed.
  \item 
  Problem: We don't understand the World Cup and we don't know where to find data for it.
  
  Solution: Find out how the World Cup works. Research various World Cup websites. Find several that are usable for our project.
  \item 
  Problem:  We don't know how to extract data from websites.
  
  Solution: Research data extraction. Make a very basic test script. See what suites are available for use.
   \item 
  Problem: We don't know how to create websites. 
    
  Solution: Research the creation of websites. Make a very basic website. See what suites are available for use.
  
  \item
  Problem: We don't live close together. 
    
  Solution: Use text messages, phone calls, and email to communicate. Use Google documents to share data.
  S
  
  \item
  Problem: The websites are in UTF-8, but when I try printing in UTF-8, it fails in certain cases.
  
  Solution: Convert it to the latin-1 encoding and then print it.
  
  \item
  Problem: Certain teams don't exist anymore.
  
  Solution: Give them their own team id anyway.
  
  \item
  Problem: There are three different types of Goals - Regular goal, Penalty goal, and Own goal.
  
  Solution: Add a Type field to goal that's an enum to describe the type of goal.
\end{itemize}

\section{Assumptions}
The assumptions we made are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our web server will not be overloaded despite not having restrictions on who can use it.
\item Our web server software will not fail.
\item The database software will be sufficient for the scope of this project.
\item The data pulled from websites is accurate.
\item We will not need multilingual support. We will support only English.
\item We will not need handicap support for our website.
\item We will not need a mobile accessible version for our website.
\item Our users are average people who do not have a computer science background but are able to comfortably use the internet.
\item Coaches should not be put into the player table.
\item Different teams have unique names. For example, there aren't two Brazil teams.
\item A player can score more than one goal in a match.
\item Teams that haven't qualified for a world cup aren't added to the database.
\end{itemize}

\section{Environment and Requirements Analysis}

\subsection{Using MondialDB}
The user will interact with MondialDB through our website. The user will connect to the website using a web~browser and a simple webpage will be displayed. The sole purpose of this website is to run specific queries from the web-server through MondialDB and send the results back to the user. The website will only contain a selection of the predefined queries. On selection, a website form will appear which will contain the necessary information to perform the specified query. Both the website and web-server will check the input for validity. Once the query is processed, a table of results will appear underneath the form.

\subsection{Extract Transform Load Tool} 
For this project we will write a python script to pull data from selected websites. The ideal script will be as simple as possible while robust enough to work with a number of different websites. We will input a list of websites and the tool should automatically convert the data into database format and insert it, or provide a script to insert it into MondialDB.

\subsection{Top-Level Information Flow Diagram}
See Figure~\ref{flow} on page \pageref{flow} for the Top-Level Information Flow Diagram. The flow is generally as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Data is input into MondialDB from Soccer Websites through Extract-Transform-Load. 
\item The user asks for the website and is provided it through the Webpage Server.
\item The Web Query Processor decides what kind of query the user is asking for.
\item The Webpage SQL Query Processor translates the user query into SQL to be executed on MondialDB.
\item The query is executed and database results are returned from MondialDB
\item The results are outputted to the user with the format depending on the kind of query.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Queries}
The types of Queries:
\begin{itemize}
	\label{queries}
	\item QGC (Query for a given cup)
	\item QGP (Query for a given player)
	\item QSS (Query for Super Stars)
	\item QTH (Query for Team History)
	\item QCP (Query for Country's Players)
	\item QPCF(Query for Country's Flag)
	\item QMA (Query for Match's Attendance)
	\item QGMS (Query for Aggressive Players)
	\item QGMR (Query for a Given Match's Referee)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Query for Country's Flag}
This query returns information about a country's flag. Most notably this includes a link to a picture of that country's flag. The query is interesting because it adds an extra dimension to the database. Users might find it easier
to recognize a country by its flag instead of by its name. Others might be curious and be inspired to learn more interesting information about flags.
Flags traditionally represent countries. They are symbols for the people of that country to rally around and to represent. They represent the history of the nation. Thus, they are interesting.
\paragraph{Query for Match's Attendance}
This query returns information about a specific match. It will give back what stadium the match was held in. It will also tell the user how many people attended that particular match. Attendance information is wonderfully informative. The user could try to find out what teams are most popular, what stadiums are most popular, or what host countries are most popular.  
\paragraph{Query for Aggressive Players}
This query tells users who the most aggressive players are. The metric of aggressiveness is determined by how many penalties they accumulate. It is interesting to see the human side of soccer and how vicious it can get.
\paragraph{Query for a Given Match's Referee}
This query tells users what referee was calling for a particular match. Many people assume referees are biased against the team that they like. By using this query, they could see if the referee really is biased against their favorite team.

\section{Extract, Transform, and Load Task}
The basic process is to grab the html of a website, parse it, and then execute a regex on its contents to capture data. 
After extraction, the program transforms the data into something acceptable.
In most cases, no transformation is necessary. However, dates always need to
be reformatted into a standard format such as YYYY-MM-DD.
After transformation, the program loads the information into the database.

Throughout extraction, transformation, and loading, the program logs important
information to files extracting\_logYmd-HMS and loading\_logYmd-HMS.

All of the ETL code can be found online at \url{https://github.com/rathomas99/fifa-world-cup-scrape}.

\section{Queries}
The SQL code for the queries follow. Note that the query for a country's flag is very easy, so it is replaced by a query to look up the top 10 venues for matches. The query for a country's flag still exists, but is not shown in the website. 

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
	#Flag query for a team with name team_name_value
	SELECT Team.Flag From Team 
	WHERE Team.Name = "'" + team_name_value + "'";
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Query for Top 10 Venues.}
This query looks up the venues that had the most soccer games played in them, the venues that had the most audience totals, and the venues that had the highest audience in a single game. This would help spot popular soccer spots across the world and show a world wide picture of the popularity of soccer.

\section{User Manual}

\subsection{How to Use the Webpage}
Go to the IP Address \url{http://100.15.105.119/}. You will see the website.
On the right hand side are various query types. If you click on the name of the query, a textbox asking for input will show up. Enter in the input that you would like to query on and then click the button "Get Result".

\subsection{How to Use the ETL Tool}
You must install the prerequisite python libraries first.
\\
\texttt{sudo pip install requests}
\\
\texttt{sudo pip install pymysql}
\\
\texttt{sudo pip install beautifulsoup4}
\\
You must set up the MySQL database with the aforementioned schema.
In \texttt{load.py}, make sure that the function openDB() has the correct 
host, user, password, and database. 
After installing the python libraries and setting up the database, run \texttt{python extract.py}. It will scrape the internet for FIFA World Cup data. The extracting python script will call the loading python script by itself. There will be two log files created. One log file will list warnings, errors, and messages from the extracting script. The other log file will list
warnings, errors, and messages from the loading script. If loading goes perfectly well, the log file will essentially look like an SQL file that inserts all the relevant data.

\section{Limitations}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The scraping doesn't always get the data it needs. 
	\item If you try to insert a goal before the players and the teams, it won't work. A goal needs to fulfill the foreign key constraints of the player existing and the teams existing.
	\item Not all players are added.
	\item Not all teams are added.
	\item If one step in the process fails, the rest of it fails too.
	\item It's slow.
	\item The extraction does not take into account penalty shootouts.
\end{enumerate}
